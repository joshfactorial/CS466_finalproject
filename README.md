## Introduction
I have written and implemented multiple sequence matching program that takes several protein sequences and attempts to match with dynamic programming. The first step in implementing this was to cluster the sequences together by how closely related they were using an algorithm called neighbor-joining made popular by the Clustal program. I found this to be an instructive and interesting challenge, even if the results weren't as impressive as I'd hoped. It performed very well on my small test samples, but had multiple problems when trying to align long, real-world sequences.
