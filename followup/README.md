# Follow-up

I tweaked the program a bit more just to see if I could get my output closer to the Clustal Omega output. Not that anyone but me will care.
I forced the program into a local alignment version of Dynamic programming to see if I got better matches that way. I think it vastly improved the program's output for long sequences, coming much closer to the Clustal Omega output than previously.

## New clustering:
('BGIBMGA000498-TA', ('Clk-PD', ('HMEL008784-PA', ('DPOGS206046-PA', 'G0YQM3_SPOEX'))))
